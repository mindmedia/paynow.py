# paynow.py
Sample for paynow qr code generator in python.

Please note that I am not a proper programmer. Self taught.
I am sure there are others who can improve this much much much more.

Please help to improve this code.

This is for the Singapore PayNow QR. This is a dynamic qr code.

A big thank you to @chengkiang. He helped me a lot with CRC part of the code.
Here is his implementation of the PayNow QR code in javascript. It looks beautiful.
